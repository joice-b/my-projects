# my-statistical-analyses
The Repo is based on the various Statistical analyses and a financial markets project that I have done. It includes linear regression, hypothesis testing, matrix algebra, data visualization and so on in the statistical analysis side(majority of these are done using R). The Financial markets project consists of monte carlo simulation, optimization, data visualization, generating random weights for components of a portfolio and so on(project done in Python).
